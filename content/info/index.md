Hello!

I'm a researcher and FX Artist currently working at [Forensis](https://www.counter-investigations.org). I have been recently awarded the [Daphne Caruana Galizia Prize for Journalism](https://daphnejournalismprize.eu/edition-2023/). I have previously worked at [Forensic Architecture](https://www.forensic-architecture.org).

My work ranges widely from 3D modelling, to data mapping and processing, to investigative research. Lately I have developed VFX for documentaries and spatial investigations. You can find my reel below:
